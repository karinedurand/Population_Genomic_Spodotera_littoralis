This repository contains scripts for performing key population genetics analyses, including calculations of dXY, FST, and nucleotide diversity (π).

## Overview

The pipeline includes the following steps:

1. **Calculating dXY**: Script `dXY.sh` computes the dXY statistic using the dependency [Dxy](https://github.com/hugang123/Dxy).
2. **Calculating FST**: Script `popstats.Fst.sh` calculates FST values for assessing population differentiation.
3. **Calculating Nucleotide Diversity (π)**: Script `popstats.pi.sh` calculates nucleotide diversity.

- **Dependency**: [Dxy GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hugang123/Dxy)
